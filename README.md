# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an 18 yo software engineer. I work 80 hours per week myself, trying to learn everything I can to create new projects, from web development to machine learning. Because I love computers, I enjoy seeing how powerful binary can be. I have many other hobbies like reading, writing, watching movies, and playing games.
